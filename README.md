Overview of how to modify cx23880/1/2/3 TV cards to improve RAW RF capture. 

# DISCLAIMER: you can get hurt or ruin stuff if you aren't careful. Perform any/all mods at your own risk. I have personally burned myself with the iron, sliced my finger open on the metal, and irreperably damaged numerous cards and amps.
